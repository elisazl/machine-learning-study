Elements in Reinforcement Learning:
1)state
2)action:Agent do action
3)reward: judge the advantage or disadvantage of the action
4)policy: the relationship between state and action, the aim of learning

The difference between Reinforcement learning(RL) and classic supervised learning(CSL):
RL: learning from experience, people cannot decide the right answer such as playing in a game
CSL:learning from teacher, people know the answer

one episode: game from the beginning to gameover
aim: try to own maximum reward in one episode

The category of RL:
1) Model-based: There is prior knowledge to the environment. 
2) Model-free: no prior knowledge. two classes: Policy-based and Value-based.

Policy-based:
1)on-policy: The agent learned and the agent interacting with the environment is the same
2)off-policy: The agent learned and the agent interacting with the environment is different
